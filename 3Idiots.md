**Review**
3 Idiots is a coming-age comedy and inspirational film directed by Rajkumar
Hirani. The story of the film is similar to that of the famous novel Five Point
Someone by Chetan Bhagat. This film is based on our Indian educational system
which pressurizes the students and has an obsession for high grades. Aamir Khan
as Rancho plays the role of a very bright student who motivates his friends pursue
their passion and make a career out of it. R.Madhavan as Farhan who wants to
become a wildlife photographer but was forced to pursue engineering because of
his strict father. 

Sharman Joshi as Raju who is pursuing engineering with the goal of getting his
family out of extreme poverty. Boman Irani as virus who plays the role of a strict
college director who is highly competitive. Kareena Kapoor as Pia who plays the
role of virus’s daughter and falls in love with Aamir khan . The film goes very
smooth. The film’s first half includes ragging scene, confrontations with the
professor, Chatur’s speech and mournful meal at Raju’s home. Overall the film
depicts a very nice mingle of comedy, suspense and motivational. All the actors
and co-actors done a commendable job. The music of the film was very soothing.
The back ground music supports the film all through the movie. Overall dipiction
is fine. Some of the scenes are really emotional. Overall rating is excellent.Its
definitely a one time watch
