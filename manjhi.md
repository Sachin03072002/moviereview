### STORY
Dashrath Manjhi, also known as Mountain Man, was a laborer in Gehlaur village, near Gaya in Bihar, India. When his wife died in 1959 due to injury caused by falling from a mountain, he decided to carve a path of 110 m long, 9.1 m wide and 7.7 m deep through a ridge of hills using only a hammer and a chisel.

### REVIEW
Nawazuddin plays Dashrath Manjhi while Radhika essays the role of his wife, Faguniya. Their village lacks even the basic amenities like schools and hospitals because of the mountain that lies in its path. Faguniya dies after falling off the mountain and succumbs to her injuries for the want of timely medical attention. Before dying she tells Dashrath, "Hum pahad paar nahi kar pae, bahut uncha hai." It does not take much time for Dashrath to decide that he must break through the mountain to carve an accessible path for the villagers. Manjhi The Mountain Man traces his tumultuous journey as he struggles to make the path and has to fight friends, family and bureaucrats alike.

He alloted 22 years of his life to curve a way thorugh the huge mountain. But the way he faced his struggles while cutting through the mountain was unbelieveable. Many a times he faced situations that we can't even think of but he didn't loose hope.

There is another scene where Dashrath is bitten by a snake that finds its way out in the open after he has cut through half of the mountain. He staggers, cries out in pain and soon cuts out the thumb that was bitten.

The film not only potrays the power of love but also brings out the problems and sufferings of people living in remote areas. It shows the cruelties and injustices faced by the people of the village in the hand of the landowners and other people who holds a greater position.The movie is made simple yet so much inspiring. One of the greatest movie I've ever seen. Definitely worth of a one-time watch.
