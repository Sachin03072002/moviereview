Tenet is an excellent, intriguing, spy thriller; mind blowing, sci-fi and espionage film by Christopher Nolan. The cinematography is spectacular and the actors are amazing in their roles.  The concept and meaning of TENET is also a palindrome which references the SATOR/ROTAS square, an ancient cryptic puzzle with clues throughout the film concerning key characters, places and organizations. Tenet is the core idea, doctrine and organizing principle. Early in the movie the Protagonist is part of a special black ops team sent to prevent a violent catastrophe that unfolds at Kiev OPERA in Ukraine. He passes his test and gets recruited by Michael Caine's character and a secretive organization, TENET. SATOR is the Russian oligarch, weapons dealer and his wife Kat who the Protagonist must meet. AREPO is the art forger whose art piece by Goya is passed off as authetic. ROTAS is a storage facility for valuable materials for wealthy patrons. There are the many Bond like moments, e.g., dangerous encounters with a variety of villians, escapes, explosions, a high stakes boat race, plus wild high speed car chases and more. Tenet the film especially plays with the concept of time, entropy, causal loops in a non-linear fashion, multiple versions of the past, present or future events and various characters' existence and interactions. The storyline twists and turns in many directions backwards and forwards plus vice versa. Neil is a friend and ally for the Protagonist who refers to the "Grandfather Paradox" and tries to explain the idea of Time Inversion. The Protagonist is trying to figure out his role and secret mission. A scientist tells the Protagonist that the future can effect the past and there are signs of the "detritus of a pending war" or something much worst. A key question for a time traveler is can a future self change past events to prevent an apocalyptic scenario? Hindsight is 20/20 or what is required is a prophetic vision.
